# Chamber Filter Control

RatOS includes built-in chamber filter control functionality.

## Prerequisites

To use the chamber control feature, you only need to configure a generic fan named `filter`:

```
[fan_generic filter]
```

## Configuration

This feature is enabled by default and requires no additional configuration. However, you can customize the settings in your printer.cfg if desired:

```
[gcode_macro RatOS]
variable_chamber_filter_enable: True                     # True|False = enable chamber filter control
variable_chamber_filter_speed: 1.0                       # float = chamber filter fan speed.
variable_chamber_filter_disable_speed: 1.0               # float = chamber filter fan speed after the print has finished.
variable_chamber_filter_enable_at: "after_print_start"   # before_print_start|after_print_start|print_end = when to enable the filter
variable_chamber_filter_disable_period: 300              # int = disable fan after X seconds after the print ends
variable_chamber_filter_disable_bed_temp: 0              # int = wait for X°C bed temp after the print ends before disabling the filter
```

## Macro Hooks

The chamber filter control includes two customizable macro hooks:

```
[gcode_macro _CHAMBER_FILTER_TURN_ON]
gcode:
    # Configuration
    {% set chamber_filter_speed = printer["gcode_macro RatOS"].chamber_filter_speed|default(0)|float %}

    # Turn filter fan on
    SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=filter SPEED={chamber_filter_speed}
```

```
[gcode_macro _CHAMBER_FILTER_TURN_OFF]
gcode:
    # Turn filter fan off
    SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=filter SPEED=0
```
